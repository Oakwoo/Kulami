Welcome to Kulami, in this repository, there is two program. They both rely on
library pygame, keras, tensflow and numpy. So if you haven't install these package
use "pip install " command install.

Kulami program is used to generate trainset data, it generate two robots and
automatically play. You can directly run main.py, you can change the parameter
stat.width and stat.height in main.py to change the board size to generate
different trainset.

Kulami_CNN_player use already trained dataset to create AI robot to play with you.
Because we trained two dataset with size=6 and size=7. So we can play with AI in
board 6 or 7, you can run main.py and select in GUI. You also can generate you own
trainset from Kulami program and copy the trainset data into Kulami_CNN_player folder.

In this game, you play first.
